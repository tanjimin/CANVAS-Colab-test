# Steps for preprocessing

1. TIFF images are be stored in the same folder with sample names. (channel names can be added with a txt file under the same name)
2. Generate zarr files for each TIFF image. (Statisitics are visualized for each zarr and for all channels)
3. Visualize and inspect selected channels.
4. Channel normalization for training. Inspect data distribution post normalization.
5. Virtual tiling step.
